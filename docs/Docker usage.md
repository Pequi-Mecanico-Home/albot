# Albot Docker usage

All of the albot environment is expected to be run inside the docker images provided. So changes made in the Dockerfile or the ``docker_gazebo.sh`` may affect the functionality of this repository.

## ``docker_gazebo.sh``

The aim of this script is to run the container with the configuration that enables the visualization of the windows generated by the ROS2/gazebo/rviz2 tools and allow the development of new packages for the ROS2 workspace.

### How to run the container correctly:

Before start the container you need to build the image that the container is based on.

This is done by executing the following command inside the albot directory:


```sh 
docker pull rafaeljose/albot
```

Now you can proceed to start the container with:

```sh 
source ./docker_gazebo.sh
```

You need to run the ``docker_gazebo.sh`` inside the albot directory so the path of the packages are correct and the docker volume works correctly

## Dockerfile (DEPRECATED)


This is the file that rules the creation of the docker image, it is important to avoid editing this file to prevent bad behavior of the albot container


## Runnig multiple instances of the terminal

While using ROS2 there will be many situations that multiple terminals are needed, in order to perform this in the albot container you need to run the following command in another terminal after the ``docker_gazebo.sh`` was executed.

```sh
docker exec -it albot-container bash
```
